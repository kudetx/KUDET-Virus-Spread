Simulation Tool:
AnyLogic Professional 8.7.11

Simulation/Programming Language:
Java (AnyLogic DSL)

Scenario of the Application
In this project, a simulation was developed to model passenger (pedestrian) flow within an airport. Passengers move through various areas such as terminal entrance, check-in, security control, restrooms and restaurants, waiting areas (either standing or seated), boarding gates, and terminal exits. By adding an epidemiological dimension to the simulation, the risk of infected individuals transmitting the disease to other passengers through contact was monitored. Additionally, this spread can be observed graphically

Defining the Goals of the Project
The aim of the project is to demonstrate and simulate pedestrian behavior and infection spread in an airport environment using an agent-based model. Through real-time graphical analyses, the time-dependent changes in the number of infected, at-risk, and healthy individuals were examined. The objective here is to observe which areas accelerate or slow down the spread of the virus and to monitor whether social distancing has an effect on virus transmission within the simulation environment.

System Definition
In this study, the developed simulation system represents an abstract digital model of an airport terminal.
The modeling does not aim to replicate the exact architecture of a real airport; rather, it focuses on logically representing functional elements such as passenger flow, service points, and epidemic spread. The main objective is to analyze the dynamics of a complex environment by constructing meaningful abstractions to observe human behavior and interactions within the system.
